== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Find more help at the [Simple Custom CSS Wiki](https://github.com/johnregan3/simple-custom-css/wiki "Simple Custom CSS Wiki")

= Will this Plugin work on my WordPress.com website? =

Sorry, this plugin is available for use only on self-hosted (WordPress.org) websites.

= Can I change the font on the x or y axes =

Not currently, but watch for that in an upcoming release.

 = How do I change the colors of the bars? =

Simply navigate to "Realtime Polls" > "Polls," then select the Poll you'd like to edit.  Here, you can edit the colors on this graph.

 = How do I Deactivate a Poll? =

The easiest way to do this is to not include its shortcode in a post/page.  In the future, we hope to have a activate/deactivate option in the backend, but currently it does not exist.

= How do I make the graphs Horizontal/Vertical? =

Currently, all graphs must have the same orientation, meaning that all must be Horizontal or Vertical.  This option is selected in "Realtime Polls" in the Default Settings, then able to be overridden in the individual Poll settings.

= What features will be available in the future? =

* Custom Fonts
* Vote Count in Polls Backend
* Reset Vote Count Button
* Reset to Defaults in the Edit Poll scrreen
* Reset Defaults on "Realtime Polls" general settings page
* Display the vote selection as radio buttons instead of a select dropdown in the front end
* Display GPS location of Bigfoot in Google Maps
